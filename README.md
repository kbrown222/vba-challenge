# vba-challenge

The purpose of this challenge is to clean-up/format raw stock data in Excel for 2018, 2019 and 2020 using a VBA script that loops through all of the stocks for one year and outputs the following information in 4 new columns:

    - The ticker symbol

    - Yearly change from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year. 
            - Positive changes are identified as green cells, neagtive changes are red cells, and net zero changes are white.

    - The percentage change (up to 2 decimals) from the opening price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year.

    - The total stock volume of the stock.
 
 The result of this script is the consolidation of each stock's performance for a calendar year, and a visual element to quickly identify whether the annual changes were positive, negative, or zero.
